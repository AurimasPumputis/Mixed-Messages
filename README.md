This is a Mixed Messages project from codecademy.com.
I've decided to take a different approach on this: it generates not a message, but info about a random day at Mars.
It uses 3 different APIs:
..*[APOD: Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://api.nasa.gov/) - provides NASA picture of the day for a given Sol.
..*[Mars Rover Photos](https://api.nasa.gov/) - provides a random photo taken by a rover on that day.
..*[MAAS2](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/maas2-rest-api-v100) - provides the weather data transmitted by the Curiosity Rover on Mars.
